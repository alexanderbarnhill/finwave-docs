Population Settings
===================

These settings are designed to help population administrators with keeping things organized.


From this page, the users can see a list of which populations they are members. Administrators of these populations have a few more options available to them.

population. This module offers the ability to create, edit, filter, and delete individuals.

Individual Creation

Individual Alternative IDs
---------------------------
Because we are aware of the fact that differing organizations have differing naming methods, the ability exists
for administrators to add alternative IDs to each individual. These will be displayed on the main page as

<main ID> / <alternate ID 1> / <alternate ID 2> ....
