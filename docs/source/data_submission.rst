There are three main components that are **required** for an encounter submission:

- :ref:`Date <date_selection>`
- :ref:`Location <location_selection>`
- Images


The following information is optional, but may help organize your submissions:

- Organization(s)
- Predation Information
- Behavior Information
- Notes



.. _date_selection:
Date Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users can select any date, as long as it is in the past.

Users have two ways to select a location. Either by clicking somewhere on the map where the encounter took place, in which the coordinates will automatically be extracted

or by specifying the coordinates in Degrees Decimal Minutes (DDM) format.

Either way, the user must select a name for the location, which will be used later in the encounter details.
