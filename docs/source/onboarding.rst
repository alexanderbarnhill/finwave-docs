Finwave Data Onboarding Documentation
=======================================

Finwave supports data onboarding through two main processes:

1. **Model Training:** Training a deep learning model to identify individuals in the population.
2. **Encounter Onboarding:** Uploading photos and metadata of historical encounters to provide a record of individuals.

----------------------------------------
1. Model Training
----------------------------------------

**Process Overview:**

- Extract identifying characteristics of individuals (usually dorsal fins) from full encounter photos.
- Use these extracted fins to train a deep learning model.
- Deploy the trained model to our model zoo for identification of individuals in newly uploaded encounters.

**Requirements for Model Training:**

- **Photos of Individuals:**
   - Photos should feature individuals in the population under consideration.
   - Cropping is not necessary, but if multiple individuals are present in the photo, it is preferable to crop the photos for easier processing.
   - Images should be clear, high resolution, and capture identifying features.

----------------------------------------
2. Encounter Onboarding
----------------------------------------

**Process Overview:**

- Photos should be arranged in a folder structure that is machine interpretable.
- Each encounterâ€™s photos should be placed in a folder that identifies the encounter. The folder naming scheme should be consistent.
- Historical encounters must include the following metadata:
    - **Location:** Name, latitude, and longitude.
    - **Photographer:** First name, last name, and optionally an email address. If the email is unavailable, a dummy email can be created temporarily.
    - **Date:** Date of the encounter.
    - **Photos:** High-quality images associated with the encounter.

**Metadata Organization:**

- Metadata can be:
    - Incorporated in the folder name.
    - Provided in a separate mapping file that associates the folder name with the relevant data.

Getting Data to Us
----------------------------------------

We offer multiple ways to upload your data to Finwave:

1. **Azure Storage Browser:**
   - We provide credentials to upload data directly to Azure storage.
   - You can use the Azure Storage Browser tool to facilitate the upload.

2. **Cloud Storage Platforms:**
   - You can send data directly via platforms such as Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.
   - We can manually import data if provided in a structured format.

3. **Finwave Onboarding Tool:**
   - Our onboarding tool automates encounter data upload directly to Finwave.
   - Currently, this involves running a Python script via the command line.
   - A cross-platform GUI tool is in development to streamline this process.

----------------------------------------
Uploading Individual Photos
----------------------------------------

For individual photos, the preferred method is to:

- Upload them via the Azure Storage Browser or cloud platforms like Google Drive.
- Place individual photos in folders where the **folder name corresponds to the identity of the individual.**

Maintaining a consistent folder structure and metadata organization ensures seamless integration with Finwave and facilitates accurate identification and encounter management.
